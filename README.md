I've been working on an interactive Virtual Pet Viewer that integrates Sketchfabâ€™s 3D viewer API with fun and engaging animations! ðŸŽ®âœ¨ This project allowed me to dive deep into enhancing user experience through creative animation controls and interactive elements. ðŸ’¡

Key Highlights:
ðŸ”¸ 3D Pet Model Integration: Seamlessly embedded a custom pet model using the Sketchfab API. 
ðŸ”¸ Animation Controls: Developed a series of animations like sleeping, rolling, shaking hands, and sitting, making the pet feel alive and engaging. 
ðŸ”¸ Interactive UI: Designed a vibrant and user-friendly interface with dynamic progress bars for hunger, happiness, and cleanliness, which update in real time. 
ðŸ”¸ Enhanced User Experience: Implemented playful hover effects, button animations, and smooth transitions to create a delightful user interaction. 
ðŸ”¸ Clean, Modern Design: Focused on responsive design and added custom styling for a visually appealing user interface. 

This project was a great opportunity to combine my passion for UI/UX design, animation, and coding. Looking forward to pushing the boundaries of interactive web experiences! ðŸŒŸ
